CI should be enabled i.e. automatically trigger build/pipeline on any code commit
Automated deployment to EKS cluster
Non-outage deployment i.e. web app should be available during deployment
Dashboards for deployment success / fail rate, timings are updated with each deployment automatically.






As a DevOps Engineer I would like to automate deployment of my docker containers for web applications to AWS EKS using AWS code build for building application and code pipeline to orchestrate build and deployment. I want AWS cloudwatch dashboards to be used to show build / deployment metrics

So that I can automated the build/deployment process. Deploy to production in non-outage mode. Get better insights on deployment metrics

Current Scope

Store source code on AWS code commit / github.
Trigger automated build process upon code commit to source code.
Build docker images and store them on ECR.
Deploy the docker image to EKS cluster.
Display deployment statistics in AWS cloudwath dashboards.
